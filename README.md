#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of ccomputer science used in developing ,testing and maintaining software.
Efficiency~helps in optimizing workflow while maintaining high quaality standards.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of software engineering(1968)~emphasized structure programming,formal methods and engineering principles.
The rise of object oriented programing(1970s~1980s)introduced concepts like encapsulation.3 The Agile revolution (2001 to present day)imtroduced the agile manifesto replacing rigid methodologies.

Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropria
Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach where each phases must be completed before moving to th next one.                                                                  ~Low flexibility,customer feedback comes late after the product has already been developed and testing is done at the end of the development process                       Agile methodology~iterative and incrementa allowing continuous improvements throughout the project                                                                                ~highly flexible,                                                                                                                                                              `continous cycle                                                                                                                                                             ~High customers provide continuous feedback after each iteration                                  
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment is a software platformthat facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing space to write,compile and debug code.    ~IMPORTANCE,An IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when developer begins typing
             , It converts the code into simplifyed languages that the operation system can understand                                                                         Version contral systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to sourse code over time just like Git                                                       `IMPORTANCE,Collaboration~Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts                                                                                     ,Error recovery~Allows reverting to previous version if new changes introduced errors                                                                                         ,Change tracking~Records detailed history of changes,allowing amalysis of each modification.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
~Limited infrustructure,limited high performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures.SOLUTION>Software engineers must rely on robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
~Software accessibility and usability,Overly complex software can frustrate and conduse users.SOLUTION>use scalable architecture,Emphasize relibility.                        ~~software security~Programming secure software is a complex and challenging .SOLUTION>Research ways to defend against hacking,malware,phishing,insider and third party threats.    
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unite testing~they consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes,components or modules used by your software.It ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly,isolated from other components.                                                                                                                   2.Integrated tests~verify that different modules of services used by your appliction work well together.Help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.                                                                                                                                                             3.System testing~Focus on the entire software system as a whole,including all functionalities and interactions.Helps to verify that the system meets all functional and non functionl requirments including performance,usability and security.                         
4.Acceptance tests~are formal test thst verify if a system satisfies business requirements.They provide the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviours.Whether the software meets the needs of the end user and is ready for deployment.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.                                                                            IMPORTANCE                                                                                                                                                                1.Increased flexibility~A promp engineer can create prompts with domain neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.                                  
2.Improved user experience~they make it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.It helps mitigate bias that may be presented for excisting human bias in the large language models training data.                                                                                                                                   3.Developer contral~they give developers more contral over users`interactions with AI.Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the lage language models.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Design for me a futuristic city with towering skyscrapers,flying cars and lit streets.The city should be eco friendly,with rooftop gardens,solar panels and Ai powering infrastructure .                                                                                                                                                                   1.Clarity and specificity~improved prompt provides clear details about the citys features including the atmosphere.                                                           2.Conciseness~While more detailed,it remains focused and to the point ensuring the key elements are included without unnecessary complexity.                                  3.Guidance~It directs the creator toward a specific vivion whioe still allowing creative freedom.
